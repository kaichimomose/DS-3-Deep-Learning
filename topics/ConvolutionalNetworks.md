## Convolutional Neural Networks

### Topics
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
  - Convolutional filters
  - Pooling layers

### Resources
- Read Brandon Rohrer's article explaining [how CNNs work] with an excellent video and example images
- Read Francois Chollet's article describing [how CNNs see the world] with images of convolutional filters
- Read Chris Olah's article [Conv Nets: A Modular Perspective][conv nets modular] with great diagrams and images
- Read Chris Olah et al.'s article on [CNN feature visualization] to learn how CNNs build up their understanding of images
- Play with Adam Harley's [interactive 2D and 3D visualizations of CNNs][CNN 3D visualization]
- Read Marco Tulio Ribeiro et al.'s [introduction to local interpretable model-agnostic explanations][LIME], a technique to explain the predictions of any machine learning classifier
- Look at the Asimov Institute's [Neural Network Zoo], an article and chart diagramming many neural network architectures
- Reference the [Keras `Sequential` model documentation][Keras sequential model] with examples of using convolutional and pooling layers

### Challenges
- Complete the [Jupyter notebook on convolutional neural networks][convolutional networks notebook]
- Modify your MNIST classifier to see how convolutional filters and maxpooling layers improve classification accuracy
